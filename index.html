      <div class ="panel-body">
        <p>I am a first-generation American who moved to Portland from Los Angeles. I've been in the food industry for 10 years, but have only been cooking for 2. After looking into the way technology is heading, I thought it wouldn't be a bad idea to be a part of that change. A friend who copleted Epicodus introduced me to the website where I learned more about the actual work needed to participate in software development. I am looking forward to working hard every day to become a savy and seasoned coder.

        <h2 class="panel-title">Why is it important?</h2>

      <div class="panel-body">
        <p>Cinema is important because after a certain generation, everyone has watched movies and television since they day they were born. Every single day at least once or twice the <span>television</span> is turned on. If you're lucky, you get to plan a trip to the theater. The <span>psychological</span> effect this has on our minds can lead us to feel a certain way, believe certain things, or even sway your opinions and decisions on many things. The <span>power</span> of cinema is enormous and not everyone is aware of its effects.</p>

        <p>As mentioned earlier, the power of cinema is strong. That means that, unfortunately, this beautiful art can be used for <em>evil</em>. It can be used for propoganda by ill-intent. There are many individuals out there who are very aware of this and purposefully continue to misuse <span>The Art of Cinema</span></p>
