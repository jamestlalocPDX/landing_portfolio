      <div class ="panel-body">
        <p>Cinema first began a long time ago on stages all over Europe. It was not always popular. Those who decided to indulge in the art, were underground revolutionaries. They were philosophers, writes, actors, singers, and dancers.Once motion picture became a thing in the United States around the time of Charlie Chaplin, it began to take off and they became widely popular.

        <h2 class="panel-title">Why is it important?</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="panel-body">
        <p>Cinema is important because after a certain generation, everyone has watched movies and television since they day they were born. Every single day at least once or twice the television is turned on. If you're lucky, you get to plan a trip to the theater. The psychological effect this has on our minds can lead us to feel a certain way, believe certain things, or even sway your opinions and decisions on many things. The power of cinema is enormous and not everyone is aware of its effects.</p>
