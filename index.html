        <p class="indent">I am a first-generation American who moved to Portland from Los Angeles. I've been in the food industry for 10 years, but have only been cooking for 2. After looking into the way technology is heading, I thought it wouldn't be a bad idea to be a part of that change. A friend who completed Epicodus introduced me to the website where I learned more about the actual work needed to participate in software development. I am looking forward towards working hard every day to become a savy and seasoned coder.
